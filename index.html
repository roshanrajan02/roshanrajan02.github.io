                <p>
                    The past 2 summers i've worked at Bazaarvoice, a shopper engagement platform based in Austin. <br>
                    During my first summer, I worked on improving the data ecosystem: First, I created a criteria to evaluate
                    different data catalogs; Then, I set up data pipelines from different data sources such as Postgres, Cassandra,
                    DynamoDB, and Kafka. The final step was doing live demos with various teams to give them an idea what day to day
                    use of this catalog would look like. I also improved an existing API to allow the Social+ team to retrieve data
                    that easier to work with. In doing so, I reworked an ETL using AWS Elastic MapReduce to change an unorganized
                    string into a well-formatted json object. <br>
                    In my most recent summer, I spent my time writing SDKs for the Content Core team's APIs, which were incredibly
                    difficult to adopt across internal business applications. This entailed creating an authentication process that
                    internal employees could utilise to access client information. Addtionally, I created and deployed a service
                    that create, package, and share EMS access credentials as required, which involved actively updated DynamoDB on
                    trigger.
